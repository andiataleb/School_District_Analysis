# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project I helped as an assistant for Pycity school district data scientist to analyze the district information to provide insights about performance and patterns at the schools within the district to eventually help the strategic decisions at the schools and district level. For this reasons, we had access to different test scores such as reading and math and the budget amount for each school and additionally whether they are charter or private school.

For this project we used jupyter notebook to perform the analysis and in order to do so I first activated a development environment on my computer. Then after collecting the data from the csd file and checking for and removing the duplicate and missing data as well as cleaning the rest of the firty data we performed our analysis.

## Summary
Based on the current analysis to this point, the following information is understood:

1) That the average math score for students at charter schools is higher than the students at public schools and this is true for all grades of the high schools of the district. 
2) Montgomery High school has the highest number of students and Chang High School has the lowest number of students. 
3) The average budget allocation for public schools is higher than the charter schools.

I also recommend comparing the average Reading and Math scores for each grade of public and charter schools separately and all grades combined.
